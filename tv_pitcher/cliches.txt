A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
Abandon ship
About face
Above board
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Ace in the hole
Ace up his sleeve
Achilles heel
Acid test
Acorn doesn't fall far from the tree
Actions speak louder than words
After my own heart
Ah
Airing dirty laundry
All bent out of shape
All bets are off
All dressed up and nowhere to go
All ears
All for one
All hands on deck
All hands to the pump
All hell breaks loose
All in a day's work
All in due time
All over the map
All paled in comparison
All talk and no action
All that glitters is not gold
All that jazz
All the bits and pieces
All thumbs
All work and no play
Alll wet
All's fair in love and war
All's well that ends well
Already got one paw on the chicken coop
Altitude is determined by attitude
Always a bridesmaid
Always look on the bright side
Am I my brother's keeper?
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An arm and a leg
An idle mind is the devil's playground
An oldie
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
Another day another dollar
Another nail in the coffin
Ants in his pants
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
Any port in a storm
Anyhoo
Anything goes
Apple of my eye
Are you a man or a mouse?
Are you fair dinkum?
Armed to the teeth
Around the horn
As all get out
As beautiful as the day is long
As dense as a London fog
As far as the eye can see
As good as gold
As honest as the day is long
As horny as a three balled tomcat
As if!!
As luck would have it
As many Chins as a Chinese phone book
As plain as the nose on your face
As snug as a bug in a rug
As tender as a mother's heart
As the crow flies
As useful as a lead balloon
As useful as tits on a bull
As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party
As ye sow
Ashes to ashes
Ask me no questions and I'll tell you no lies
Ask not what your country can do for you
Asleep at the wheel
Ass backwards
Ass over tea kettle
At the crack of dawn
At the drop of a hat
At the eleventh hour
At the end of my rope
At the end of the day...
At the end of the pecking order
At the last minute
At wits' end
Atta boy
Atta girl
Ax to grind
Babe in the woods
Baby blues
Baby boomer

Barking up the wrong tree
Barn burner
Basket case
Bass Ackwards
Bat the idea around
Bats in the belfry
Batten down the hatches
Be in the same boat
Be it ever so humble there's no place like home
Be there or be square
Bear down
Beat a dead horse
Beat around the bush
Beat it!
Beat swords into ploughshares
Beat the bushes
Beat the street
Beats me
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty is only skin deep
Bee in her bonnet
Been there
Bee's knees
Before you were the gleam in your father's eye
Beggars can't be choosers
Behind the eight ball
Behind the times
Belle of the ball
Bells and whistles
Bend over
Bend over backwards
Best laid plans of mice and men
Best thing since sliced bread
Bet it all
Bet the farm
Bet your bottom dollar
Better half
Better late than never
Better light a candle than curse the darkness
Better safe than sorry
Better than a kick in the teeth
Better than ever
Better the Devil you know than the Devil you don't
Between a rock and a hard place
Beware the ides of March
Big as a house
Big as life
Big brother is watching
Big cheese
Big head
Big heart
Big mouth

Can't squeeze blood out of a turnip
Can't teach an old dog new tricks

His mouth is writing checks his body can't cash
Her elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor

Hump day
Hunker down
Hurl insults
I beg to differ
I can't stomach that
I could whip you with one arm tied behind my back
I hate to say this
I have no bones about that
I heard that!
I need that like I need a hole in my head
I never met a man I didn't like
I second that
I want my place in the sun
I wasn't born yesterday
I wouldn't piss on your teeth if they were on fire
I wouldn't trust him as far as I could spit
Ice water in her veins
Icing on the cake
I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached
Idle hands are the devil's workshop
If a frog had wings
If I've said it once
If the shoe fits
If wishes were horses
If you can't stand the heat
If you can't take Mohammed to the mountain
If you chase two rabbits
If you don't have anything nice to say
If you get the sense
If you're going to talk the talk
I'll be a monkey's uncle
I'll be damned
I'll be the judge of that
I'll bet a dollar to a doughnut
I'll bet dollars to doughnuts
I'll fix you
I'll leave you with something to chew on
Ill-fated idea
I'm not getting any younger
In a coon's age
In a wink
In cold blood
In fine fettle
In for a penny
In harm's way
In on the ground floor
In one fell swoop
In the black
In the cards
In the clear
In the hot seat
In the joint
In the nick of time
In the pink
In the red
In two shakes of a lamb's tail
In your dreams
In your face
Inched out
Indian giver
Is a frog's ass water tight?
Is a pig pork?
Is a pig pork?
Is it soup yet?
Is the Pope Catholic?
Isn't all it's cracked up to be
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
It ain't rocket science
It is good to be king
It takes two to tango
It will do
It won't fly
It's no use crying over spilled milk
It's a game of inches
It's a lemon
It's a wash
It's all fun and games until someone loses an eye.
It's all over but the crying
It's better than a sharp stick in the eye
It's business
It's in the bag
It's never too late to learn
It's not a sprint
It's not over till it's over
It's not the size of the dog in the fight.  It's the size of the fight in the dog.
It's not whether you win or lose
It's raining like a cow pissing on a flat rock
It's what's on the inside that counts
I've got it covered
I've had it up to here

Like a chicken with his head cut off
Like a coiled spring
Like a lost dog in the high weeds
Like butter
Like chalk and cheese

Like oil and water
Like shit off a shovel
Like shooting ducks on a pond
Like there is no tomorrow
Like white on rice

Lion's den
Lion's share
Lipstick on a pig
Litmus test
Little bird told me
Little of this
Live and learn
Living high off the hog
Llie like a rug
Lock
Long and short of it
Long arm of the law
Long in the tooth
Long row to hoe
Long shot
Long time no see
Long ways away
Look before you leap
Look into your heart
Look out!
Look over your shoulder
Looking at the world through rosy colored glasses
Looking for a needle in a haystack
Looped
Loose cannon
Loose your shirt
Looser
Lord willin' and the creek don't rise
Lose your lunch
Lost a step
Love is blind
Lower than a snake's belly

Monkey wrench
Monkeying around

Mouth off
Mud slinging
Mug for the camera
Murphy's law
Must be seeing things
My bad
My brain is fried
My hands are tied
My stomach is tied up in knots
My way or the highway
Nail biter
Naked as a jaybird.
Naked as the day you were born
Near and dear to my heart
Necessary evil
Necessity is the mother of invention
Nerves of steel
Nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof
Nervous as a long tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs

Not playing with a full deck
Not the brightest bulb
Not the brightest crayon in the box
Not the ghost of a chance
Not the sharpest crayon in the box
Not the sharpest knife in the cabinet
Not the sharpest pencil in the box
Nothing personal
Nothing to sneeze at
Nothing to write home about
Nothing up my sleeve
Nothing ventured
Now or never
Object of desire
Off and running
Off like a prom dress!
Off the cuff
Off the dime
Off the hook
Off the shelf
Off the top of my head
Off your rocker
Off-kilter
Oh brother
Oh my God!
Oh my goodness
Old as dirt
Old ball and chain
Old school
On a lark
On a roll
On a short leash
On a soap box
On a wing and a prayer
On fire
On par
On pins and needles
On skid row
On tenterhooks
On the back burner
On the ball
On the cutting edge
On the fly
On the front burner
On the level
On the make
On the road again
On the same page
On the same plate
On the take
On the tip of my tongue
On the up and up
On track
On your toes
Once burned
Once in a blue moon
One bad apple spoils the barrel
One foot on a banana peel the other in the grave
One good turn deserves another
One in million
One man's garbage is another man's treasure
One night stand
One taco short of a combination plate
Open book
Open the kimono
Opportunity doesn't knock twice
Out of gas
Out of it
Out of pocket
Out of sight
Out of the clear blue
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Out of the woods
Out of whack
Out sowing your wild oats
Out to lunch
Over a barrel
Over and over again
Over my head
Over the hill
Over the top
Pack it in
Pain in the ass
Pain in the neck
Paint yourself into a corner
Pandora's box
Paper over
Paper tiger
Par for the course
Pass away
Pass on
Pass the buck
Pass the hat
Passed with flying colors
Path of least resistance
Pay as you go
Pay lip service
Pay the piper
Pay through the nose
Payback is a b#tch
Pearls before swine
Peas in a pod
Peel the onion
Pencil me in
Penny for your thoughts
Penny pincher
Penny saved is a penny earned
Penny wise and pound foolish
People who live in glass houses
Perception becomes reality
Phone it in
Pick of the litter
Pick the low hanging fruit
Picture's worth a thousand words
Piece of cake
Pig dog
Pig headed
Pig out
Pin our hopes on
Piss on the chips
Pissed to the gills
Pissing in the wind
Piss-poor
Plain and simple
Plain as day
Plastered
Play ball
Play for the name on the front of your jersey
Play it by ear
Play second fiddle to
Play the race card
Play the field
Play the hand you're dealt
Play with the big boys
Plenty of other fish in the sea
Plenty of other fish to fry
Plunk down
Poison the well
Polluted
Poor as a church mouse
Pop a vein
Pot calling the kettle black
Pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
Pound for pound
Pound of flesh
Pound the pavement
Pound the table
Pour oil on trouble waters
Pour the Kool-Aid
Powers of darkness
Preach the choir
Preach to the converted
Press the flesh
Pretty penny
Propped up
Pull a rabbit out of a hat
Pull any stunts
Pull the wool over your eyes
Pull your leg
Pulling your hair
Punch his lights out
Punched in the gut
Pure as the driven snow
Push the envelope
Push your buttons
Pushing up daisies
Put a cork in it
Put a lid on it
Stick a sock in it
Put it through its paces
Put on ice
Put out some feelers
Put that in your pipe and smoke it
Put the pedal to the metal
Put two and two together
Put your best foot forward
Put your foot in your mouth
Put your heart into it
Put your money where your mouth is
Putting the cart before the horse
Quick buck
Quicker than a New York minute
Quiet as a mouse
Quit horsing around!
Rain on my parade
Raining cats and dogs
Raining pitchforks
Raise the bar
Raking it in
Rat hole
Rat out
Rattle your cage
Raw end of the deal
Read between the lines
Read the fine print
Read you her the riot act
Real gulley washer
Real McCoy
Real toad strangler
Red carpet treatment
Red herring
Red sky in the morning
Reinvent the flat tire
Reinvent the wheel
Reopen an old wound
Rest on your laurels
Rhyme or reason
Riding on
Rifle for an arm
Right on the button
Right on the money
Right on the nose
Right up your alley
Ring a bell
Ring your bell
Rising tide lifts all boats
Road less traveled
Road to hell
Roll of the dice
Roll out the red carpet
Rolling in the dough
Rolling stone gathers no moss
Rollover on
Built in a day
Rotten to the core
Rough around the edges
Rough as a cob
Rough road
Rub salt in the wound
Rub your face in it
Rubs me the wrong way
Run circles around
Run for your money
Run it up the flagpole
Same bat time
Same song and dance
Save the drama for your mama
Save your breath
Say what you will....
Say your prayers
Scarce as hen's teeth
Scared of his own shadow
Scraping the bottom of the barrel
Second banana
Second wind
See eye to eye
See the glass as half empty
See the light
See the whole field
See which way the winds blow
See you later alligator
See's the glass as half full
Sell out
Sensory overload
Separate the men from the boys
Separate the wheat from the chaff
Serve up a fat pitch
Serve up a lollipop
Serve up a softball
Set the table
Seven year itch
Shit eating grin
Shit or get off the pot
Shit out of luck
Shake hands with the wife's best friend
Shape up or ship out
Sharp as a marble
Sharp as a tack
She has a great personality
Shed light on
She'll be right
She's a peach
She's been hit with an ugly stick
She's lost her marbles
Shirty
Shoe in
Shoe is on the other foot
Shoestring budget
Shoot from the hip
Shoot straight
Shoot the breeze
Shoot the rock
Shoot yourself in the foot
Shooting fish in a barrel 
Shooting for the moon
Shop talk
Short changed
Short end of the stick
Short fuse
Short pleasures are often long regretted
Shot across the bow
Shot in the dark
Shotgun wedding
Shove off
Show him the door
Show me the money!
Show some backbone
Show some spunk
Show them how the cow ate the cabbage
Shuffle off this mortal coil
Shut out
Shut the hole in your head
Shut up
Shut your hole
Shut your mouth
Sick as a dog
Sick to death of it
Signed
Silence is golden
Silenced the crowd
Sing like a bird
Sink or swim
Sink your teeth into
Sit tight
Sitting in the catbird seat
Six of one
Skate on thin ice
Skeletons in the closet
Slam dunk
Pat on the back
Slicker than snot on a door knob
Slipped through your fingers
Slippery slope
Sloppy as a soup sandwich
Sloshed
Slow and steady wins the race
Slow as a wet week
Slow as molasses in January
Sly as a fox
Small potatoes
Small world
Smashed
Smell ripe
Smoke and mirrors
Smoking gun
Smooth operator
Smooth over
SNAFU
Snail's pace
Snockered
Snow job
Snowball's chance in hell
So close
So ugly
Sod off
Solid as a rock
Someday
Sometimes you are the hydrant
Sometimes you are the windshield
Son of a b#tch
Son of a gun
Sound like a broken record
Sounds like a plan
Soup to nuts
South end of a north bound horse
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Speak with a forked tongue
Spinning your wheels
Spit in one hand and wish in the other
Spitting image
Split second
Splitting hairs
Spoon full of sugar helps the medicine go down
Spread the news
Spruce up
Squeaky wheel gets the grease
Squeal on
Stack the deck
State of the art
Stay tuned
Stem the tide
Step on it
Stepping on people's toes
Stick a fork in him
Stick in the mud
Stick it in your ear
Stick it out
Stick it to you
Stick it where the sun don't shine
Stick to your guns
Stick with it
Sticks and stones will break my bones
Sticky subject
Stiff as a board
Stitch in time saves nine
Stone faced
Stone the crows!
Stoned
Stone's throw away
Stop and smell the roses
Stop him
Stop on a dime
Stop the presses!
Straight arrow
Straighten up and fly right
Stress out
Stretch a dollar
String him along
Strong as an ox
Stubborn as a mule
Stuck out like a sore thumb
Stuck-up
Stuffed shirt
Suck up
Sucker
Sugar in his pants
Sugarcoat something
Survival of the fittest
Swallow one's pride
Sweat equity
Sweat the details
Sweep it under the rug
Sweet 16 and never been kissed
Sweet deal
Sweeten the pot
Sweetheart deal
Swim against the tide
Swim up stream
Swim with the sharks
Swimming in molasses
Tail between his legs
Take a back seat to
Take a bath
Take a breather
Take a dump
Take a leak
Take a long walk off a short pier
Take a picture
Take a step back
Take care of your knitting
Take five
Take it easy
Take it from me
Take it to the limit
Take it with a grain of salt
Take one for the team
Take stock of
Take the bull by the horns
Take the crowd out of the game
Take the easy way out
Take the gloves off
Take the plunge
Take the wind out of your sail
Take the world by storm
Take your life in your own hands
Taken for a ride
Takes its toll on you
Taking the scenic route
Talk to the hand
Talk shop
Talk until you are blue in the face
Talking behind his back
Tall tale
Tanked
Taste of your own medicine
Teach him to fish
Teacher's pet
Team player
Tear you a new #sshole
Technicolor Yawn
Tell a prokie
Tell it to me straight
Tempest in a teapot
Ten to one
Tend the garden
Test the waters
Testing one's mettle
Thank goodness
Thank your lucky stars
That and a quarter will get you a cup of coffee
That burns me up
That chaps my hide
That dog won't hunt
That gets my goad
That hits the spot
That takes the cake
That was cold-blooded
That which does not kill you makes you stronger
That's a doozy
That's a joke
That's a load off my mind
That's a wrap
That's bogus
That's for the birds
That's how the cow eats the cabbage
That's just peachy
That's no joke
That's the sixty-four thousand
That's the ticket
That's the way lady luck dances
That's the way the ball bounces
That's the way the cookie crumbles
That's water under the bridge
The best things in life are free
The bomb
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself
Their ace
There is a god
There is more than one way to skin a cat
There is no cow on the ice
There is no I in team
There is no time like the present
There now
There ought to be a law against that
There
There'll be hell to pay
There's a sucker born every minute
There's gold in them thar hills
There's no place like home
There's no such thing as a free lunch
There's no time like the present
There's something fishy about that
They can't buy a basket/run/score
They need to take care of the rock
They play good D
Thick as a brick
Thick as a ditch
Thick as pea soup
Thick headed
Things aren't what they used to be
Think like a man
Think outside the box
Thinking with the wrong head
Third time's a charm
Third wheel
Thirty thousand
Thorn in my side
Those who do not look back from where they come from
Three sheets to the wind
Threw a curve ball
Threw it with a little something on it
Through thick and thin
Throw me a bone
Throw me some scraps
Throw your hat in the ring
Throw cold water on
Throw down
Throw gas on the fire
Throw in the towel
Throw the baby out with the bathwater
Throw the book at him
Throw to the wolves
Throwing aspirin tablets
Thumb your nose at
Thumbs up
Tickled pink
Tie the knot
Tie the know
Tight as a drum
Tight as the bark on a tree
Tight wad
Tighten your belt
Tighter than a gnat's ass
Tilting at windmills
Timber!
Time after time
Time and again
Time flies when you're having fun
Time heals all wounds
Time is money
Time is running out
Time of your life
Time on your hands
Time out
Time's up
Times
To be honest with you
To each his own
To the victor go the spoils
To toy with
Today is the first day of the rest of your life
Toe the line
Tongue in cheek
Tongue lashing
Tongue tied
Too many chefs spoil the broth
Too many chiefs and not enough
Too many cooks spoil the soup 
TMI
Too much sail for a small craft
Too rich for my blood
Took off like a bat out of hell
Took off like a shot
Took something off that one
Toot his own horn
Too good to be true
Tooth and nail
Top banana
Top dog
Tore up from the floor up
Toss your cookies
Touch and go
Tow the line
Tread lightly
Trial balloon
Trial by fire
Tried and true
Trip over your tongue
Trojan horse
Truth is stranger than fiction
Tugging at heartstrings
Tune out
Turn on a dime
Turn over a new leaf
Twiddling your thumbs
Twist my arm
Twist of fate
Two faced
Two heads are better than one
Two left feet
Two ships passing in the night
Two wrongs don't make a right
Ugly as a hat full of holes
Ugly as a mud fence
Ugly as sin
Under a microscope
Under her thumb
Under the gun
Under the knife
Under the table
Unless you are the lead dog
Until the cows come home
Up a creek without a paddle
Up for grabs
Up in arms
Up shits creek
Up the ante
Uphill battle
Useless as tits on a boar hog
Variety is the spice of life
Virgin on prom night
Wait for the ink to dry
Waiting for the dust to settle
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
Waiting for your ship to come in
Waiting with baited breath
Wake-up and smell the coffee
Wake-up call
The wrong side of the bed
Walk on the wild side
Walk softly and carry a big stick
Walking on eggshells
Walled garden
Walls have ears
Walls start closing in
Wankered
Wash your hands of something
Washed up
Wasted
Watch your mouth
Watched pot never boils
Watching the clock
Water water everywhere
Wave the white flag
Through his stomach
Way to go Einstein!
Way to go Grace
Wear many hats
Wear your heart out on your sleeve
Welcome to my hell
Welcome to the club
Cross that bridge
Jump that fence when we get to it
Well off
We're gonna tie one on tonight
Were you born in a barn?
Were you raised by wolves?
Wet behind the ears
Wet blanket
Wet dream
Wham
What a blast
What a duck!
What a square
What a tangled web we weave
What a way to go
What am I
What are you stewing about?
What are you? Chicken?
What does that have to do with the price of tea in China?
What goes around comes around
What goes up
What in tar nation?
What on earth is wrong with me?
What rock did you crawl out from under?
What you see is what you get
What you see
Whatever floats your boat
Whatever tickles your fancy
Whatever turns you on
What's a little thing among friends
What's cookin' good lookin'?
What's going down?
What's good for the goose is good for the gander
What's he been smoking?
What's that got to do with the price of eggs in Chicago
What's up with that?
What's up?!
What's wrong with this picture?
Wheel is turning but the hamster is dead
When all is said and done
When hell freezes over
When in Rome
When it rains
When life gives you lemons
When pigs fly
When push comes to shove
When the going gets tough
When you lie with dogs
Where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's a will
Where's the Beef?
Whistling in the dark
White elephant gift
White knuckle ride
Who died and left you in charge?
Whole nine yards
Whole shootin' match
Whoop it up
Who's the man?
Why buy the cow when the milk is free?
Why close the barn door after the horse is gone?
Why on God's green Earth?
Wig out
Win
Wing it
Winning combination
Wipe the slate clean
Wish upon a star
Wishy
Witch hunt
With one hand tied behind my back
With tongue firmly planted in cheek
Wolf in sheep's clothing
Work into a lather
Work like a dog
Work the crowd
Work the room
Work your fingers to the bone
Worker bee
Working my last good nerve
World of hurt
World of trouble
World on a string
Worm has turned
Worry wart
Worth its weight in gold
Wound tighter than a spring
Wrong side of the tracks
Yank your chain
You ain't seen nothin' yet
You can lead a horse to water
You can never go home again
You can say that again
You can take that to the bank
A mile in their shoes
You can't fit a square peg in a round hole
You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube
You can't stop him. You can only hope to contain him.
You can't swing a dead cat
You can't take knickers off a bare arse
You could have knocked me over with a feather
You don't have a leg to stand on
You don't miss the water till the well runs dry
You got it coming to you
You got your just desserts
You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette
You lost me
You make a better door than a window
You make your bed
You must crawl before you can walk
You scratch my back
You snooze
Young loins
Young
Your father wasn't a glass maker
Your goose is cooked
Your place or mine
You're a good egg
You're going to get it
You've got nerve
You've got more front than Myers
Zigged when he should have zagged
Zip it!
Zip your lip
Zoo
