  :name: Allegory
  :definition: An allegory is a symbolism device where the meaning of a greater, often
    abstract, concept is conveyed with the aid of a more corporeal object or idea
    being used as an example. Usually a rhetoric device, an allegory suggests a meaning
    via metaphoric examples.
  :example: ! 'Faith is like a stony uphill climb: a single stumble might send you
    sprawling but belief and steadfastness will see you to the very top.'

  :name: Alliteration
  :definition: Alliteration is a literary device where words are used in quick succession
    and begin with letters belonging to the same sound group. Whether it is the consonant
    sound or a specific vowel group, the alliteration involves creating a repetition
    of similar sounds in the sentence. Alliterations are also created when the words
    all begin with the same letter. Alliterations are used to add character to the
    writing and often add an element of ‘fun’ to the piece..
  :example: The Wicked Witch of the West went her own way. (The ‘W’ sound is highlighted
    and repeated throughout the sentence.)

  :name: Allusion
  :definition: An allusion is a figure of speech whereby the author refers to a subject
    matter such as a place, event, or literary work by way of a passing reference.
    It is up to the reader to make a connection to the subject being mentioned.
  :example: It’s no wonder everyone refers to Mary as another Mother Teresa in the
    making; she loves to help and care after people everywhere- from the streets to
    her own friends. In the example the author uses the mention of Mother Teresa to
    indicate the sort of qualities that Mary has.

  :name: Amplification
  :definition: Amplification refers to a literary practice wherein the writer embellishes
    the sentence by adding more information to it in order to increase its worth and
    understandability. When a plain sentence is too abrupt and fails to convey the
    full implications desired, amplification comes into play when the writer adds
    more to the structure to give it more meaning.
  :example: ! 'Original sentence- The thesis paper was difficult. After amplification-
    The thesis paper was difficult: it required extensive research, data collection,
    sample surveys, interviews and a lot of fieldwork.'

  :name: Anagram
  :definition: Anagrams are an extremely popular form of literary device wherein the
    writer jumbles up parts of the word to create a new word. From the syllables of
    a phrase to the individual letters of a word, any fraction can be jumbled to create
    a new form. Anagram is a form of wordplay that allows the writer to infuse mystery
    and a little interactive fun in the writing so that the reader can decipher the
    actual word on their own and discover a depth of meaning to the writing.
  :example: An anagram for "debit card" is "bad credit". As you can see, both phrases
    use the same letters. By mixing the letters a bit of humor is created.

  :name: Analogy
  :definition: An analogy is a literary device that helps to establish a relationship
    based on similarities between two concepts or ideas. By using an analogy we can
    convey a new idea by using the blueprint of an old one as a basis for understanding.
    With a mental linkage between the two, one can create understanding regarding
    the new concept in a simple and succinct manner.
  :example: In the same way as one cannot have the rainbow without the rain, one cannot
    achieve success and riches without hard work.

  :name: Anastrophe
  :definition: Anastrophe is a form of literary device wherein the order of the noun
    and the adjective in the sentence is exchanged. In standard parlance and writing
    the adjective comes before the noun but when one is employing an anastrophe the
    noun is followed by the adjective. This reversed order creates a dramatic impact
    and lends weight to the description offered by the adjective.
  :example: He spoke of times past and future, and dreamt of things to be.

  :name: Anecdote
  :definition: The word anecdote, phonetically pronounced an.ik.doht, means a short
    verbal accounting of a funny, amusing, interesting event or incident. The story
    is usually a reminiscence from the teller's life but at best is a related story
    of fact, as opposed to a contrived work of fiction. The origin of the word anecdote
    comes from the Greek Byzantine period, A.D. 527 to 565 during the reign of emperor
    Justinian. In his court, Justinian had a historian named Procopius who was a gifted
    writer who wrote many witty, amusing and somewhat bawdy accounts of court life.
    Never intending for this stories to become public he entitled his writings as
    “Anecdota” which was Greek for unpublished and kept secret. After his secret writings
    did indeed become public and published, the term anecdote became commonly used
    for similar accounts.
  :example: ! 'Amusing anecdotes many times find their way into wedding receptions,
    family reunions and any other gathering of people who know each other well. Teachers
    and educators often tell classrooms of pupils anecdotes about famous people. The
    anecdotes are not always flattering, but are usually revealing of character and
    invariably amusing. Here is an example of an anecdote about Winston Churchill:
    Winston Churchill was very fond of his pet dog Rufus. He ate in the dining room
    with the family on a special cloth and was treated with utmost respect. When enjoying
    movies, Rufus had the best seat in the house; on Winston Churchill''s lap. While
    watching “Oliver Twist,” Churchill put his hands over Rufus'' eyes during the
    scene where Bill Sike''s intends to drown his dog. Churchill is believed to have
    said to Rufus: “don''t look now, dear. I''ll tell you about it later.”'

  :name: Anthropomorphism
  :definition: Anthropomorphism can be understood to be the act of lending a human
    quality, emotion or ambition to a non-human object or being. This act of lending
    a human element to a non-human subject is often employed in order to endear the
    latter to the readers or audience and increase the level of relativity between
    the two while also lending character to the subject.
  :example: The raging storm brought with it howling winds and fierce lightning as
    the residents of the village looked up at the angry skies in alarm.

  :name: Antithesis
  :definition: An antithesis is used when the writer employs two sentences of contrasting
    meanings in close proximity to one another. Whether they are words or phrases
    of the same sentence, an antithesis is used to create a stark contrast using two
    divergent elements that come together to create one uniform whole. An antithesis
    plays on the complementary property of opposites to create one vivid picture.
    The purpose of using an antithesis in literature is to create a balance between
    opposite qualities and lend a greater insight into the subject.
  :example: When Neil Armstrong walked on the moon it might have been one small step
    for a man but it was one giant leap for mankind.

    tone to state a principle or an opinion that is generally understood to be a universal
    truth. Aphorisms are often adages, wise sayings and maxims aimed at imparting
    sense and wisdom. It is to be noted that aphorisms are usually witty and curt
    and often have an underlying tone of authority to them.

  :name: Archetype
  :definition: An archetype is a reference to a concept, a person or an object that
    has served as a prototype of its kind and is the original idea that has come to
    be used over and over again. Archetypes are literary devices that employ the use
    of a famous concept, person or object to convey a wealth of meaning. Archetypes
    are immediately identifiable and even though they run the risk of being overused,
    they are still the best examples of their kind.
  :example: Romeo and Juliet are an archetype of eternal love and a star-crossed love
    story.

  :name: Assonance
  :definition: Assonance refers to repetition of sounds produced by vowels within
    a sentence or phrase. In this regard assonance can be understood to be a kind
    of alliteration. What sets it apart from alliterations is that it is the repetition
    of only vowel sounds. Assonance is the opposite of consonance, which implies repetitive
    usage of consonant sounds.
  :example: “A long song”. (Where the ‘o’ sound is repeated in the last two words
    of the sentence)

  :name: Asyndeton
  :definition: Asyndeton refers to a practice in literature whereby the author purposely
    leaves out conjunctions in the sentence, while maintaining the grammatical accuracy
    of the phrase. Asyndeton as a literary tool helps in shortening up the implied
    meaning of the entire phrase and presenting it in a succinct form. This compact
    version helps in creating an immediate impact whereby the reader is instantly
    attuned to what the writer is trying to convey. Use of this literary device helps
    in creating a strong impact and such sentences have greater recall worth since
    the idea is presented in a nutshell.
  :example: 1. Read, Write, Learn. 2. Watch, Absorb, Understand. 3. Reduce, Reuse,
    Recycle.

  :name: Authorial Intrusion
  :definition: Authorial Intrusion is an interesting literary device wherein the author
    penning the story, poem or prose steps away from the text and speaks out to the
    reader. Authorial Intrusion establishes a one to one relationship between the
    writer and the reader where the latter is no longer a secondary player or an indirect
    audience to the progress of the story but is the main subject of the author’s
    attention.
  :example: In many olden novels, especially in suspense novels, the protagonist would
    move away from the stream of the story and speak out to the reader. This technique
    was often used to reveal some crucial elements of the story to the reader even
    though the protagonist might remain mystified within the story for the time being.

  :name: Bibliomancy
  :definition: As the very name itself suggests, this kind of literary device finds
    its roots in biblical origins. This term refers to the practice of basing a plot
    happening or event and anticipating the results it will have on a faction of the
    Bible. It involves a random selection process wherein the biblical passage is
    chosen as a founding stone for basing the outcome of the writing. In an overall
    context, not limited to just literature, bibliomancy refers to foretelling the
    future by turning to random portions of the Bible for guidance.
  :example: The Vedas serve as a tool for Bibliomancy to the Hindus while Muslims
    rely on the Koran.

  :name: Bildungsroman
  :definition: This is a very popular form of storytelling whereby the author bases

    of the story. As the story progresses, the subject undergoes noticeable mental,
    physical, social, emotional, moral, and often spiritual advancement and strengthening
    before the readers’ eyes. It has often been seen that the protagonist begins with
    views, aims and dreams that are in contrast to the other character’s in the story
    and then fights his or her way through to achieve them.
  :example: Scarlet O’Hara in Gone With the Wind experiences immense personal growth
    as she learns the value of friends and hard work under duress, without compromising
    her own dreams.

  :name: Caesura
  :definition: This literary device involves creating a fracture of sorts within a
    sentence where the two separate parts are distinguishable from one another yet
    intrinsically linked to one another. The purpose of using a caesura is to create
    a dramatic pause, which has a strong impact. The pause helps to add an emotional,
    often theatrical touch to the sentence and conveys a depth of sentiment in a short
    phrase.
  :example: Mozart- oh how your music makes me soar!

  :name: Circumlocution
  :definition: Circumlocution is a form of writing where the writer uses exaggeratedly
    long and complex sentences in order to convey a meaning that could have otherwise
    been conveyed through a shorter, much simpler sentence. Circumlocution involves
    stating an idea or a view in an indirect manner that leaves the reader guessing
    and grasping at the actual meaning.
  :example: Instead of writing “At 8 pm he arrived by car for the dinner party.” the
    author writes, “Around 3 hours after sunset, it was winter at the time, the man
    arrived in a combustion engine driven piece of technology with for wheels to join
    other bipedal creatures in the ingestion of somewhat large quantities of food
    and drink while having discourse around a large wooden mesa designed for such
    a purpose”.

    in a building where a family lives. If the word "home" was used instead in the
    above sentence in place of "house", the meaning would not be so literal as there
    are many emotions associated with the word "home" beyond simply the structure
    where people live.

  :name: Deus ex Machina
  :definition: Deus ex Machina is a rather debatable and often criticized form of
    literary device. It refers to the incidence where an implausible concept or character
    is brought into the story in order to make the conflict in the story resolve and
    to bring about a pleasing solution. The use of Deus ex Machina is not recommended
    as it is seen to be the mark of a poor plot that the writer needs to resort to
    random, insupportable and unbelievable twists and turns to reach the end of the
    story.
  :example: If in a suspense novel the protagonist suddenly finds a solution to his
    dilemmas because of divine intervention.

    and style of writing. Diction is usually judged with reference to the prevailing
    standards of proper writing and speech and is seen as the mark of quality of the
    writing. It is also understood as the selection of certain words or phrases that
    become peculiar to a writer.

    usually bear the ability to impersonate the original but have vastly different
    spirits and intentions. The doppelganger usually has a different appearance but
    an earthly soul and supernatural hoodwinking abilities that allow it to fool other
    unsuspecting characters.

    author describes another work of art, usually visual. It is used to convey the
    deeper symbolism of the corporeal art form by means of a separate medium. It has
    often been found that ekphrastic writing is rhetorical in nature and symbolic
    of a greater meaning.

    loss. Similarly, one can convey the same sentiments and concepts by using phrases
    such as ‘an empty doorway’ or ‘a childless nursery’.

  :name: Epilogue
  :definition: ! 'Epilogues are an inherent part of any story or poem and are essential
    to the structure of any written form. The epilogue is an important literary tool
    that acts as the afterword once the last chapter is over. The purpose of an epilogue
    is to add a little insight to some interesting developments that happen once the
    major plot is over. Epilogues often act as a teaser trailer to any possible sequels
    that might be created later. Sometimes the epilogue is used to add a little bit
    about the life or future of the main characters after the story itself has unfolded
    and wrapped up. Epilogues can be written in a number of ways: sometimes the same
    narrative style as adopted in the story is continued while at other times one
    of the characters might take up the narrative or speak one to one with the audience.'
  :example: In a remarkably contemporary moment at the end of The Tempest, Shakespeare's
    wizard Prospero addresses the audience directly, breaking down the boundaries
    of the play. He informs them that the play is over, his powers are gone, and thus
    his escape from the play's island setting depends on their applause that they,
    in effect, get to decide his fate. This serves as a Epilogue for Shakespeare's
    tragi-comedy The Tempest.

  :name: Euphemism
  :definition: The term ‘euphemism’ is used to refer to the literary practice of using
    a comparatively milder or less abrasive form of a negative description instead
    of its original, unsympathetic form. This device is used when writing about matters
    such as sex, violence, death, crimes and things "embarrassing". The purpose of
    euphemisms is to substitute unpleasant and severe words with more genteel ones
    in order to mask the harshness.. The use of euphemisms is sometimes manipulated
    to lend a touch of exaggeration or irony in satirical writing.
  :example: Using “to put out to pasture” when one implies retiring a person because
    they are too old to be effective. Below are some more examples of Euphemisms Downsizing
    - This is used when a company fires or lays off a larger number of employees Friendly
    fire - This is used by the military when soldiers are accidentally killed by other

    used to create pleasant sounds. Euphony is the opposite of cacophony, which refers
    to the creation of unpleasant and harsh sounds by using certain words and phrases
    together. This literary devices is based on the use and manipulation of phonetics
    in literature.
  :example: It has been said that the phrase “cellar door” is reportedly the most
    pleasant sounding phrase in the English language. The phrase is said to depict
    the highest degree of euphony, and is said to be especially notable when spoken
    in the British accent.

  :name: Faulty Parallelism
  :definition: In literature, the term ‘parallelism’ is used to refer to the practice
    placing together similarly structure related phrases, words or clauses. Parallelism
    involves placing sentence items in a parallel grammatical format wherein nouns
    are listed together, specific verb forms are listed together and the like. When
    one fails to follow this parallel structure, it results in faulty parallelism.
    The failure to maintain a balance in grammatical forms is known as faulty parallelism
    wherein similar grammatical forms receive dissimilar or unequal weight.

    of specific events to the reader, which have taken place before the present time
    the narration is following, or events that have happened before the events that
    are currently unfolding in the story. Flashback devices that are commonly used
    are past narratives by characters, depictions and references of dreams and memories
    and a sub device known as authorial sovereignty wherein the author directly chooses
    to refer to a past occurrence by bringing it up in a straightforward manner. Flashback
    is used to create a background to the present situation, place or person.
  :example: Back in the day when Sarah was a young girl… You can see flashbacks used
    very often in movies. For example, it is common in movies for there to be a flashback
    that gives the viewer a look into the characters life when they were younger,
    or when they have done something previously. This is done to help the viewer better
    understand the present situation.

    Albus Dumbledore, who portrays ‘good’, is constantly shown to believe in the power
    of true love (of all forms and types) and is portrayed as a strong, benevolent
    and positive character while the antagonist Lord Voldemort, who depicts the evil
    and ‘bad’ in the series is constantly shown to mock and disbelieve the sentiment
    of love and think of it as a foolish indulgence, a trait that is finally his undoing.

    or phrases and hints that set the stage for a story to unfold and give the reader
    a hint of something that is going to happen without revealing the story or spoiling
    the suspense. Foreshadowing is used to suggest an upcoming outcome to the story.
  :example: “He had no idea of the disastrous chain of events to follow”. In this
    sentence, while the protagonist is clueless of further developments, the reader
    learns that something disastrous and problematic is about to happen to/for him.

  :name: Hubris
  :definition: Hubris, in this day and age, is another way of saying overly arrogant.
    You can tell the difference of hubris and just regular arrogance or pride by the
    fact that the character has seemed to allow reality slip away from them. The character
    portraying hubris, also commonly referred to as hybris, may have just gained a
    huge amount of power and the false belief that they are “untouchable”. This term
    hubris used to have a slightly different meaning and was a very negative subject
    back in ancient Greek. It used to be closely related to a crime in Athens. In
    writing and literature hubris is generally considered a “tragic flaw” and it is
    saved for the protagonist. The reason for this is because at the end of the story
    you should be able to see that it is this flaw that brings the “bad guy” down.
  :example: A classic example of hubris is featured in Shakespeare’s play Macbeth.
    Macbeth, the protagonist, overfilled with ambition and arrogance, allows his hubris
    to think you would be able to kill the valiant Duncan without penalty so he can
    claim the throne of Scotland for himself. Obviously murder is highly frowned upon,
    so this eventually leads to Macbeth’s demise as well.

  :name: Hyperbaton
  :definition: A hyperbaton is a literary device wherein the author plays with the
    regular positioning of words and phrases and creates a differently structured
    sentence to convey the same meaning. It is said that by using a hyperbaton, words
    or phrases overstep their conventional placements and result in a more complex
    and intriguing sentence structure. This literary device is used to add more depth
    and interest to the sentence structure.
  :example: “Alone he walked on the cold, lonely roads”. This sentence is a variation
    of the more conventional, “He walked alone on the cold, lonely roads”.

    and phrases that exaggerate and overemphasize the basic crux of the statement
    in order to produce a grander, more noticeable effect. The purpose of hyperbole
    is to create a larger-than-life effect and overly stress a specific point. Such
    sentences usually convey an action or sentiment that is generally not practically/
    realistically possible or plausible but helps emphasize an emotion.

    asleep standing here”.

  :name: Imagery
  :definition: In literature, one of the strongest devices is imagery wherein the

    forms in order to “tickle” and awaken the readers’ sensory perceptions is referred
    to as imagery. Imagery is not limited to only visual sensations, but also refers
    to igniting kinesthetic, olfactory, tactile, gustatory, thermal and auditory sensations
    as well.
  :example: The gushing brook stole its way down the lush green mountains, dotted
    with tiny flowers in a riot of colors and trees coming alive with gaily chirping
    birds.

  :name: Internal Rhyme
  :definition: In literature the internal rhyme is a practice of forming a rhyme in
    only one lone line of verse. An internal rhyme is also known as the middle rhyme
    because it is typically constructed in the middle of a line to rhyme with the
    bit at the end of the same metrical line.
  :example: The line from the famed poem Ancient Mariner, “We were the first that
    ever burst”.

  :name: Inversion
  :definition: The term ‘inversion’ refers to the practice of changing the conventional
    placement of words. It is a literary practice typical of the older classical poetry
    genre. In present day literature it is usually used for the purpose of laying
    emphasis this literary device is more prevalent in poetry than prose because it
    helps to arrange the poem in a manner that catches the attention of the reader
    not only with its content but also with its physical appearance; a result of the
    peculiar structuring.
  :example: ! 'In the much known and read Paradise Lost, Milton wrote: “Of Man''s
    First Disobedience, and the Fruit Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal taste Brought
    Death into the World, and all our woe, With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, Sing Heav''nly Muse. . .”'

  :name: Irony
  :definition: The use of irony in literature refers to playing around with words
    such that the meaning implied by a sentence or word is actually different from
    the literal meaning. Often irony is used to suggest the stark contrast of the
    literal meaning being put forth. The deeper, real layer of significance is revealed
    not by the words themselves but the situation and the context in which they are
    placed.
  :example: Writing a sentence such as, “Oh! What fine luck I have!”. The sentence
    on the surface conveys that the speaker is happy with their luck but actually
    what they mean is that they are extremely unhappy and dissatisfied with their
    (bad) luck.

  :name: Juxtaposition
  :definition: Juxtaposition is a literary device wherein the author places a person,
    concept, place, idea or theme parallel to another. The purpose of juxtaposing
    two directly or indirectly related entities close together in literature is to
    highlight the contrast between the two and compare them. This literary device
    is usually used for etching out a character in detail, creating suspense or lending
    a rhetorical effect.
  :example: In Paradise Lost, Milton has used juxtaposition to draw a parallel between
    the two protagonists, Satan and God, who he discusses by placing their traits
    in comparison with one another to highlight their differences.

  :name: Kennings
  :definition: The use of Kennings in literature is characteristically related to
    works in Old English poetry where the author would use a twist of words, figure
    of speech or magic poetic phrase or a newly created compound sentence or phrase
    to refer to a person, object, place, action or idea. The use of imagery and indicative,
    direct and indirect references to substitute the proper, formal name of the subject
    is known as kennings. The use of kennings was also prevalent in Old Norse and
    Germanic poetry.
  :example: ! 'Kennings are rare in modern day language. Here are a few examples from
    Beowulf: Battle-sweat = blood Sky-candle = sun Whale-road = ocean Light-of-battle
    = sword'

  :name: Litote
  :definition: ! 'Litotes are figures of rhetoric speech that use an understated statement
    of an affirmative by using a negative description. Rarely talked about, but commonly
    used in modern day conversations, litotes are a discreet way of saying something
    unpleasant without directly using negativity. Sometimes called an ironical understatement
    and/or an avoidance of a truth which can be either positive or negative. Common
    examples: “I''m not feeling bad,” or “he''s definitely not a rocket scientist.”
    The actual meanings are: “I am feeling well,” and “he is not smart.” Litotes were
    used frequently in Old English Poetry and Literature, and can be found in the
    English, Russian, German, Dutch and French languages.'
  :example: ! 'In everyday conversations in the 21st century, one may hear expressions
    like: “not the brightest bulb” “not a beauty” “not bad” “not unfamiliar” These
    are all examples of negative litotes that mean the opposite: “a dim bulb, or dumb,”
    “plain in appearance,” “good,” and “knows very well.” Perhaps our society is not
    trying to be humorous or sarcastic, but kinder? Sometimes double negatives in
    literature, music and films create a litote that was not intended; for instance
    in the Rolling Stones hit “I Can''t Get No Satisfaction,” actually means “I CAN
    receive satisfaction.” Perhaps some best description litotes are found in the
    bible: take for instance, Jeremiah 30:19: “I will multiply them, and they shall
    not be few; I will make them honored, and they shall not be small.” Correctly
    interpreted, he is saying “there will be many and they will be great or large.”'

  :name: Malapropism
  :definition: Malapropism in literature refers to the practice of misusing words
    by substituting words with similar sounding words that have different, often unconnected
    meanings, and thus creating a situation of confusion, misunderstanding and amusement.
    Malapropism is used to convey that the speaker or character is flustered, bothered,
    unaware or confused and as a result cannot employ proper diction. A trick to using
    malapropism is to ensure that the two words (the original and the substitute)
    sound similar enough for the reader to catch onto the intended switch and find
    humor in the result.
  :example: In the play Much Ado About Nothing, noted playwright William Shakespeare’s
    character Dogberry says, "Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two auspicious
    persons." Instead, what the character means to say is “"Our watch, sir, have indeed
    apprehended two suspicious persons."

  :name: Metaphor
  :definition: Metaphors are one of the most extensively used literary devices. A
    metaphor refers to a meaning or identity ascribed to one subject by way of another.
    In a metaphor, one subject is implied to be another so as to draw a comparison
    between their similarities and shared traits. The first subject, which is the
    focus of the sentences is usually compared to the second subject, which is used
    to convey a degree of meaning that is used to characterize the first. The purpose
    of using a metaphor is to take an identity or concept that we understand clearly
    (second subject) and use it to better understand the lesser known element (the
    first subject).
  :example: “Henry was a lion on the battlefield”. This sentence suggests that Henry
    fought so valiantly and bravely that he embodied all the personality traits we
    attribute to the ferocious animal. This sentence implies immediately that Henry
    was courageous and fearless, much like the King of the Jungle.

  :name: Metonymy
  :definition: Metonymy in literature refers to the practice of not using the formal
    word for an object or subject and instead referring to it by using another word
    that is intricately linked to the formal name or word. It is the practice of substituting
    the main word with a word that is closely linked to it.
  :example: When we use the name “Washington D.C” we are talking about the U.S’ political
    hot seat by referring to the political capital of the United States because all
    the significant political institutions such as the White House, Supreme Court,
    the U.S. Capitol and many more are located her. The phrase “Washington D.C.” is
    metonymy for the government of the U.S. in this case.

  :name: Mood
  :definition: The literary device ‘mood’ refers to a definitive stance the author
    adopts in shaping a specific emotional perspective towards the subject of the
    literary work. It refers to the mental and emotional disposition of the author
    towards the subject, which in turn lends a particular character or atmosphere
    to the work. The final tone achieved thus is instrumental in evoking specific,
    appropriate responses from the reader.
  :example: In Erich Segal’s Love Story, the relationship of the two protagonists
    is handled with such beauty, delicateness and sensitivity that the reader is compelled
    to feel the trials and tribulations of the characters.

- :id: 1413
  :name: Motif
  :definition: The literary device ‘motif’ is any element, subject, idea or concept
    that is constantly present through the entire body of literature. Using a motif
    refers to the repetition of a specific theme dominating the literary work. Motifs
    are very noticeable and play a significant role in defining the nature of the
    story, the course of events and the very fabric of the literary piece.
  :example: In many famed fairytales, the motif of a ‘handsome prince’ falling in
    love with a ‘damsel in distress’ and the two being bothered by a wicked step mother,
    evil witch or beast and finally conquering all to live ‘happily ever after’ is
    a common motif. Another common motif is the simple, pretty peasant girl or girl
    from a modest background in fairytales discovering that she is actually a royal
    or noble by the end of the tale.

  :name: Negative Capability
  :definition: The use of negative capability in literature is a concept promoted
    by poet John Keats, who was of the opinion that literary achievers, especially
    poets, should be able to come to terms with the fact that some matters might have
    to be left unsolved and uncertain. Keats was of the opinion that some certainties
    were best left open to imagination and that the element of doubt and ambiguity
    added romanticism and specialty to a concept.
  :example: The best references of the use of negative capability in literature would
    be of Keats’ own works, especially poems such as Ode on a Grecian Urn and Ode
    to a Nightingale.

  :name: Nemesis
  :definition: In literature, the use of a nemesis refers to a situation of poetic
    justice wherein the positive characters are rewarded and the negative characters
    are penalized. The word also sometimes refers to the character or medium by which
    this justice is brought about as Nemesis was the patron goddess of vengeance according
    to classical mythology.
  :example: In the popular book series Harry Potter, the protagonist Harry Potter
    is the nemesis of the evil Lord Voldemort.

  :name: Onomatopoeia
  :definition: The term ‘onomatopoeia’ refers to words whose very sound is very close
    to the sound they are meant to depict. In other words, it refers to sound words
    whose pronunciation to the actual sound they represent.
  :example: Words such as grunt, huff, buzz and snap are words whose pronunciation
    sounds very similar to the actual sounds these words represent. In literature
    such words are useful in creating a stronger mental image. For instance, sentences
    such as “the whispering of the forest trees” or “the hum of a thousand bees” or
    “the click of the door in the nighttime” create vivid mental images.

  :name: Oxymoron
  :definition: Oxymoron is a significant literary device as it allows the author to
    use contradictory, contrasting concepts placed together in a manner that actually
    ends up making sense in a strange, and slightly complex manner. An oxymoron is
    an interesting literary device because it helps to perceive a deeper level of
    truth and explore different layers of semantics while writing.
  :example: Sometimes we cherish things of little value. He possessed a cold fire
    in his eyes.

  :name: Paradox
  :definition: A paradox in literature refers to the use of concepts or ideas that
    are contradictory to one another, yet, when placed together hold significant value
    on several levels. The uniqueness of paradoxes lies in the fact that a deeper
    level of meaning and significance is not revealed at first glace, but when it
    does crystallize, it provides astonishing insight.
  :example: High walls make not a palace; full coffers make not a king.

    the human feelings of one or more of his or her characters to nonhuman objects
    or nature or phenomena. It is a type of personification, and is known to occur
    more by accident and less on purpose.
  :example: The softly whistling teapot informed him it was time for breakfast.

  :name: Periodic Structure
  :definition: In literature, the concept of a periodic structure refers to a particular
    placement of sentence elements such as the main clause of the sentence and/or
    its predicate are purposely held off and placed at the end instead of at the beginning
    or their conventional positions. In such placements, the crux of the sentence’s
    meaning does not become clear to the reader until they reach the last part. While
    undeniably confusing at first, a periodic structure lends a flair of drama and
    romanticism to a sentence and is greatly used in poetry.
  :example: Instead of writing, “brokenhearted and forlorn she waited till the end
    of her days for his return” one may write, “for his return, brokenhearted and
    forlorn, waited she till the end of her days”.

  :name: Periphrasis
  :definition: The term ‘periphrasis’ refers to the use of excessive language and
    surplus words to convey a meaning that could otherwise be conveyed with fewer
    words and in more direct a manner. The use of this literary device can be to embellish
    a sentence, to create a grander effect, to beat around the bush and to draw attention
    away from the crux of the message being conveyed.
  :example: Instead of simply saying “I am displeased with your behavior”, one can
    say, “the manner in which you have conducted yourself in my presence of late has
    caused me to feel uncomfortable and has resulted in my feeling disgruntled and
    disappointed with you”.

  :name: Plot
  :definition: ! 'The plot usually refers to the sequence of events and happenings
    that make up a story. There is usually a pattern, unintended or intentional, that
    threads the plot together. The plot basically refers to the main outcome and order
    of the story. There is another kind of plot in literature as well; it refers to
    the conflict or clash occurring as a part of the story. The conflict usually follows
    3 regular formats: a) characters in conflict with one another b) characters in
    conflict with their surroundings and c) characters in conflict with themselves.'

  :name: Point of View
  :definition: Point of view is the manner in which a story is narrated or depicted
    and who it is that tells the story. Simply put, the point of view determines the
    angle and perception of the story unfolding, and thus influences the tone in which
    the story takes place. The point of view is instrumental in manipulating the reader’s
    understanding of the narrative. In a way, the point of view can allow or withhold
    the reader access into the greater reaches of the story. Two of the most common
    point of view techniques are the first person, wherein the story is told by the
    narrator from his or her standpoint and the third person wherein the narrator
    does not figure in the events of the story and tells the story by referring to
    all characters and places in the third person with third person pronouns and proper
    nouns.
  :example: In the popular Lord of the Rings book series, the stories are narrated
    in the third person and all happenings are described from an “outside the story”
    point of view. Contrastingly, in the popular teen book series, Princess Diaries,
    the story is told in the first person, by the protagonist herself.

    words frequently in a sentence, placed very close to one another. Opposed to the
    usual norm of using them sparsely, only where they are technically needed. The
    use of polysyndetons is primarily for adding dramatic effect as they have a strong
    rhetorical presence.
  :example: ! 'For example: a) Saying “here and there and everywhere”, instead of
    simply saying “here, there and everywhere”. b) “Marge and Susan and Anne and Daisy
    and Barry all planned to go for a picnic”, instead of “Marge, Susan, Anne, Daisy
    and Barry…” emphasizes each of the individuals and calls attention to every person
    one by one instead of assembling them as a group.'

    two or more words in order to create an entirely new word. This is often done
    in order to create a name or word for something by combining the individual characteristics
    of 2 or more other words.
  :example: 1. The word “smog” is a portmanteau that was built combining “fog” and
    “smoke” and “smog” has the properties of both fog and smoke. 2. Liger= Lion +
    Tiger= A hybrid of the two feline species, possessing characteristics of both.

    a “sneak peek” into the story. Prologues are typically a narrative ‘spoken’ by
    one of the characters and not from the part of the author.

    suggest meanings of similar-sounding words. The trick is to make the reader have
    an “ah!” moment and discover 2 or more meanings.

    of the lines in the prose or poetry. Rhyme scheme refers to the order in which
    particular words rhyme. If the alternate words rhyme, it is an “a-b-a-b” rhyme
    scheme, which means “a” is the rhyme for the lines 1 and 3 and “b” is the rhyme
    affected in the lines 2 and 4.

    of a human weakness or character flaw. The use of satire is often inclusive of
    a need or decision of correcting or bettering the character that is on the receiving
    end of the satire. In general, even though satire might be humorous and may “make
    fun”, its purpose is not to entertain and amuse but actually to derive a reaction
    of contempt from the reader.
  :example: An example of satire in modern popculture is the TV series Southpark that
    uses satire as it primary medium for drawing attention the flaws in society, especially
    American society at present. The scripts and writing for the show are an excellent
    example of satire in written form.

  :example: In the first installment of the Harry Potter series, a large part of the
    book takes place at the protagonist, Harry’s, aunt’s and uncle’s place, living
    in the “muggle” (non-magical) world with the “muggle” folks, and Harry is unaware
    of his magical capabilities and blood. This setting establishes the background
    that Harry has a non-magical childhood with other “muggle” people and has no clue

    dissimilar things, people, beings, places and concepts. By using similes a greater
    degree of meaning and understanding is attached to an otherwise simple sentence.
    The reader is able to better understand the sentiment the author wishes to convey.
    Similes are marked by the use of the words ‘as’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’.

  :name: Stream of consciousness
  :definition: The phrase ‘stream of consciousness’ refers to an uninterrupted and
    unhindered collection and occurrence of thoughts and ideas in the conscious mind.
    In literature, the phrase refers to the flow of these thoughts, with reference
    to a particular character’s thinking process. This literary device is usually
    used in order to provide a narrative in the form of the character’s thoughts instead
    of using dialogue or description.
  :example: All writings by Virginia Woolff are a good example of literary stream
    of consciousness. "Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life
    is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning
    of consciousness to the end." The Common Reader (1925)

  :name: Suspense
  :definition: Suspense is the intense feeling that an audience goes through while
    waiting for the outcome of certain events. It basically leaves the reader holding
    their breath and wanting more information. The amount of intensity in a suspenseful
    moment is why it is hard to put a book down. Without suspense, a reader would
    lose interest quickly in any story because there is nothing that is making the
    reader ask, “What’s going to happen next?” In writing, there has to be a series
    of events that leads to a climax that captivates the audience and makes them tense
    and anxious to know what is going to happen.
  :example: A cliffhanger is a great way to create suspense. You remember when you
    were a kid and very excited to watch those Saturday morning shows. You can probably
    recall the feeling you had at the pit of your stomach when, after about 25 minutes
    and lots of commercials, you were hoping to find out what happened to your favorite
    character. However, you didn’t get to find out. Instead they would make the “Tune
    In Next Week” announcement and you already knew that you would be there. Same
    time, same place. Suspense is a powerful literary tool because, if done correctly,
    you know your audience will be back for more and more.

    often concealed at first sight, and is representative of several other aspects,
    concepts or traits than those that are visible in the literal translation alone.
    Symbol is using an object or action that means something more than its literal
    meaning.

    refer to the whole. It is somewhat rhetorical in nature, where the entire object
    is represented by way of a faction of it or a faction of the object is symbolized
    by the full.
  :example: “Weary feet in the walk of life”, does not refer to the feet actually
    being tired or painful; it is symbolic of a long, hard struggle through the journey
    of life and feeling low, tired, unoptimistic and ‘the walk of life’ does not represent
    an actual path or distance covered, instead refers to the entire sequence of life
    events that has made the person tired.

  :name: Syntax
  :definition: Syntax in literature refers to the actual way in which words and sentences
    are placed together in the writing. Usually in the English language the syntax
    should follow a pattern of subject-verb-object agreement but sometimes authors
    play around with this to achieve a lyrical, rhythmic, rhetoric or questioning
    effect. It is not related to the act of choosing specific words or even the meaning
    of each word or the overall meanings conveyed by the sentences.
  :example: The sentence "The man drives the car" would follow normal syntax in the
    English language. By changing the syntax to "The car drives the man", the sentence
    becomes awkward.

  :name: Theme
  :definition: The theme of any literary work is the base topic or focus that acts
    as a foundation for the entire literary piece. The theme links all aspects of

    can be an enduring pattern or motif throughout the literary work, occurring in
    a complex, long winding manner or it can be short and succinct and provide a certain
    insight into the story.

    events by which one or more of the literary characters in the story undergo several

    prevent the problem from taking over e) the problem results in some catastrophic,
    grave ending, which is the tragedy culminated.'
  :example: ! 'In the play Julius Caesar, the lead character is an ambitious, fearless
    and power hungry king who ignores all the signs and does not heed the advice of
    the well-meaning: finally being stabbed to death by his own best friend and advisor
    Brutus. This moment has been immortalized by the phrase “Et tu Brutus?”, wherein
    Caesar realizes that he has finally been defeated, and that too through betrayal.'

  :name: Understatement
  :definition: This literary device refers to the practice of drawing attention to
    a fact that is already obvious and noticeable. Understating a fact is usually
    done by way of sarcasm, irony, wryness or any other form of dry humor. Understating

    long”. Said in a sarcastic tone it indicates that the speaker obviously means
    the opposite of the literal meaning.

  :name: Verisimilitude
  :definition: Verisimilitude tends to be based around the appearance or proximity
    to being real, or the truth. It was a large part of the work of Karl Popper, and
    can be used in a variety of different ways to describe something, as well. It
    is a way of implying the believability or likelihood of a theory or narrative.
    However, just because something can be described as having Verisimilitude does
    not mean that it is true, only that merely appears to or seems to be true.
  :example: It can be used in a variety of ways, for example; “While some dislike
    the content of the novel due to its graphic nature, you cannot deny that the content
    certainly gives the book some Verisimilitude” An example of Verisimilitude in
    concept, though, could be a doubtful statement in a court of law or even a false
    testimonial for a restaurant. If something “seems” like it’s all well and good,
    but you can’t quite decide, then it can be said to have Verisimilitude.
